Here is some data for testing out a text
reformating program.  I don't really think it matters very much
what
the text is, so long as it goes on for a few lines -- and contains examples of all the usual
sorts of
punctuation, etc.  So let us have another sentence and
then leave at that, at least
for the time being.
